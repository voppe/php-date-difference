PHP Date Difference
========

Calculate the difference between two given dates without using any of the built in PHP date functions or objects.

Assumptions
-----------

* Dates will be provided in the format “YYYY/MM/DD” for example “2015/03/21”.
* All dates will be based on the Gregorian calendar.
* The return value should be an object in the format:

```php
stdClass {
    int   $years,        // The number of years between the two dates.
    int   $months,       // The number of months between the two dates.
    int   $days,         // The number of days between the two dates less the months and the years.
    int   $total_days,   // The total days between the two dates including the months and years.
    bool  $invert        // true if the the difference is negative (i.e. $start > $end).
}
```
